"""
You are given a sorted list of distinct integers nums. Write a function search_rotated to search for a target value
target in the rotated list.

A rotated list is a list that has been rotated by some number of elements. For example, [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] might
become [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] after being rotated by 4 elements. Note that the list is still sorted and does not
contain any duplicates.

Your task is to implement the function search_rotated to find the index of the target value in the rotated list.
If the target is not in the list, return -1.

Example
Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0

Output: 4

Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 3

Output: -1

Constraints
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
The algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
